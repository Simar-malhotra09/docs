## Code 

### Computer Vision
1. [The Chan-Vese Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.2782) – [PAPER] An active contour segmentation method effective for objects without well-defined edges. [skimage API](https://scikit-image.org/docs/0.25.x/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_chan_vese.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-segmentation-plot-chan-vese-py)
2. [Accelerating Chan-Vese Model with Cross Modality Guided
Contrast Enhancement for Liver Segmentation](https://helvia.uco.es/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10396/30548/Author_copy_Chan_vese.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=3)- [PAPER] contrast enhancement as preprocessing step and gpu implementation of Chan-Vese. They do not provide any code, only the design.

### Software Optimization
1. [Software optimization resources](https://www.agner.org/optimize/) – [WEBPAGE] Manuals on optimizing C++ and assembly for different platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS), guides to Intel and AMD CPU architectures, and more.
2. [What does it mean for code to be "cache-friendly"?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16699247/what-does-it-mean-for-code-to-be-cache-friendly) – [FORUM]
3. [On memory optimization (by the folks over at Sony)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160422113037/http://www.research.scea.com/research/pdfs/GDC2003_Memory_Optimization_18Mar03.pdf) – [PDF]
4. [C++ Design Patterns for Low-latency Applications Including High-frequency Trading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04259) – [PAPER] Cache warming, `constexpr`, and more.
5. [Follow-up discussion on 4](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40908273) – [FORUM] Hacker News thread with helpful commentary.

### Git
1. [Git fetch vs pull](https://longair.net/blog/2009/04/16/git-fetch-and-merge/) – [BLOG] Why you should use `git fetch` + merge/rebase instead of `pull`. Probably the clearest explanation of Git I’ve encountered.



## Quant
> **Note:** “Quant” here is used very loosely — this section doesn’t *only* focus on QIS or highly formal mathematical finance.

### General
1. [arXiv Quantitative Finance archive](https://arxiv.org/archive/q-fin) – [PAPER]
2. [AQR Capital](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research) – [WEBPAGE] One of the few management firms consistently publishing high-quality, research-driven blogs.
3. [Quantocracy](https://quantocracy.com/) – [WEBPAGE] Curated mashup of quantitative trading links.

### Books
1. [Financial Market Complexity by Neil Johnson et all](https://books.google.com/books/about/Financial_Market_Complexity.html?id=QJnOwQEACAAJ)- 2003, A physicits take on financial market complexity. 

### Risk Management
1. [A Full Guide to Risk Management](https://www.vertoxquant.com/p/a-full-guide-to-risk-management) – [BLOG] Covers risk metrics like VaR, volatility modeling, and more—with code.

### Indian Markets 
1. [SEBI's working papers](https://www.sebi.gov.in/sebiweb/home/HomeAction.do?doListing=yes&sid=4&ssid=81&smid=104)- [WEBPAGE]

6. [DefectTrack: real-time defect tracking in in-situ TEM](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9489724/) – [PAPER]
7. [STEM image analysis with deep learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04272) – [PAPER] CNNs for identifying sulfur vacancies & MoS₂ polymorphs.

## Books

>**Note:** I wish my lexicon weren't so pathetic that I couldn't describe how I feel about some of the books here. But I'll be selective with what I add; each one means something to me. I'd love to talk about any of these,feel free to email me, open an issue, or just reach out somehow.
1. [manazuru by Hiromi Kawakami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manazuru_(novel))- 2006. Hiromi Kawakami is simply her (yet again). I had only read some of her shorter works like [Parade](https://www.amazon.com/Parade-Folktale-Hiromi-Kawakami/dp/1593765800) before this, and found them unusual yet interesting, but Manazuru helped me better understand and appreciate her style. I love books that disregard traditional grammatical rules — one example would be Infinite Jest by DFW — and the sparing use of quotation marks in Manazuru was a great touch, in my opinion.
   
## Video Essays
1. [Fukushima - The Dirty Truth about Japan's Nuclear Nightmare | Investigate Asia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13b2TVom5gc&ab_channel=InvestigateAsia)- I've always been curious in knowing more about fukushima and this scratches all my itches.
